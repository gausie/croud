	title = {The Effectiveness of Crowdsourcing Public Participation in a Planning Context},
	url = {http://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=1709555},
	abstract = {In late 2009, the Next Stop Design project was launched to test the crowdsourcing model in a public participation context for transit planning. Crowdsourcing is an online, distributed problem solving and production model largely in use for business. It leverages the collective intelligence of online communities by soliciting ideas and solutions for an organization from these communities through the form of an open call. Next Stop Design was an online competition where users submitted bus stop shelter designs and voted on the designs of peers to determine a best design. The project provided an opportunity to assess the effectiveness of crowdsourcing as an alternative public participation method for government administration. Online public participation alternatives are increasingly the focus of governments seeking to overcome deficiencies in traditional public participation methods, and the specific online method of crowdsourcing is a promising ideation tool for participatory decision-making. To test Next Stop Design's effectiveness as a public participation tool participants were interviewed to determine their perceptions of the project. In all, 23 Next Stop Design participants were interviewed via instant messenger for this study. Findings presented here suggest that Next Stop Design was perceived to be a generally effective online deliberative democratic process, with perceived weaknesses concerning the facilitation of the project through public voting and the equality of participants on the site in light of apparent voting fraud in the competition.},

	abstract = {Online crowdsourcing platforms are increasingly used to capture ideas from crowd. Global companies are adopting crowdsourcing idea to connect with and get feedback from the users. The objective of this study was to understand what would motivate people to participate to innovate in online crowdsourcing platform, and to classify different motivational factors and incentives in online crowdsourcing platform. After an extensive literature review on motivation and incentive, different motivational factors and incentives were classified. This study has identified various motivational factors and classified them so that researchers can have more empirical studies to understand better. Moreover, the findings will also be worthwhile for the companies who are planning to launch similar crowdsourcing platforms to tap users' talents.},

	abstract = {Within volunteered geographic information ({VGI}), citizen science stands out as a class of activities that require special attention and analysis. Citizen science is likely to be the longest running of {VGI} activities, with some projects showing continuous effort over a century. In addition, many projects are characterised by a genuine element of volunteering and contribution of information for the benefit of human knowledge and science. They are also tasks where data quality and uncertainty come to the fore when evaluating the validity of the results. This chapter provides an overview of citizen science in the context of {VGI} – hence the focus on geographic citizen science. This chapter highlights the historical context of citizen science and its more recent incarnation. It also covers some of the cultural and conceptual challenges that citizen science faces and the resulting limitation on the level of engagement. By drawing parallels with the Participatory Geographic Information Systems ({PGIS}) literature, the chapter offers a framework for participation in citizen science and concludes with the suggestion that a more participatory mode of citizen science is possible.},

	abstract = {The Open Database License ({ODbL}) is a license agreement intended to allow users to freely share, modify, and use this Database while maintaining this same freedom for others. Many databases are covered by copyright, and therefore this document licenses these rights. Some jurisdictions, mainly in the European Union, have specific rights that cover databases, and so the {ODbL} addresses these rights, too. Finally, the {ODbL} is also an agreement in contract for users of this Database to act in certain ways in return for accessing this Database.

Databases can contain a wide variety of types of content (images, audiovisual material, and sounds all in the same database, for example), and so the {ODbL} only governs the rights over the Database, and not the contents of the Database individually. Licensors should use the {ODbL} together with another license for the contents, if the contents have a single set of rights that uniformly covers all of the contents. If the contents have multiple sets of different rights, Licensors should describe what rights govern what contents together in the individual record or in some other way that clarifies what rights apply.

Sometimes the contents of a database, or the database itself, can be covered by other rights not addressed here (such as private contracts, trade mark over the name, or privacy rights / data protection rights over information in the contents), and so you are advised that you may have to consult other documents or clear other rights before doing activities not covered by this License},
